let firstScore = 6
let secondScore = 4

// There are two operators that check for equality: == checks two values are the same, and != (pronounced “not equals”) checks two values are not the same:
firstScore == secondScore
firstScore != secondScore

// There are four operators for comparing whether one value is greater than, less than, or equal to another. These are just like in mathematics:
firstScore < secondScore
firstScore >= secondScore

// Each of these also work with strings, because strings have a natural alphabetical order:
"Taylor" <= "Swift"
